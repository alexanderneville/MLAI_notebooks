    "# Nonparametric Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression uses the traing data to approximate a function with a set of paramters, often labelled $\\mathbf{w}$. The model can classify unseen data with these parameters alone, without requiring the training data. Such a model is called *parametric*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Nonparametic* models retain the training set as part of the model and are often more complicated than those that can be defined with a finite set of paramaters. Sometimes nonparametric models are called *instance-based learning* or *memory-based learning* models.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple such model is the *table lookup* model. $h(\\mathbf{x})$ returns the corresponding $y$ if $\\mathbf{x}$ is in the table. This model is very poor at generalising and cannot return an output if the input is not part of the training set."
